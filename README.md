# ProxyMenu
A macOS menubar application to quickly toggle on/off the socks proxy option in network settings and the block all incoming connections option in the system firewall settings.

This branch contains the original RubyMotion version of the app which is now unmaintained. All future development will take place in the master branch using Swift.
